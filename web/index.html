					<p>Microkernels are operating systems that implement most operating system
					functionality and policy decisions (typically including device drivers and
					file systems) in ordinary user space processes while providing universal
					and mostly policy-free kernel mechanisms as prerequisites for said operating
					system functionality.</p>
					
					<p>Microkernel-based operating systems come in many different flavours, each
					having a&nbsp;distinctive set of goals, features and approaches. Some of the most
					often cited reasons for structuring an operating system as a&nbsp;microkernel is
					flexibility, modularity, maintainability, safety, security, reliability,
					certifiability and fault tolerance. Many microkernels support real-time constraints
					and can take on the role of a&nbsp;hypervisor, too. Microkernels and their user
					environments are most often implemented in a system programming language such as C,
					C++ or Rust with a&nbsp;little bit of assembly, but other implementation languages
					are possible, too. In fact, the modular architecture allows for each component of
					a&nbsp;microkernel-based operating system to be implemented in a&nbsp;different
					programming language.</p>
					
					<p>This is a&nbsp;list of active free, open source microkernel projects. If your
					project is missing or this page needs fixing, please
					<a href="https://github.com/jermar/microkernel.info/compare">create a&nbsp;pull request</a>.</p>
